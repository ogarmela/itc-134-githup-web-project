            <h1>Why is Artificial Intelligence in medicine important?
</h1>
            <p>Keeping abreast of mountains of data. Medical data is expected to double every 73 days by 2020. AI can make sense of the overwhelming amount of clinical data, genomic data and social determinants of health data to find the best path for each patient.</p>
            

<P>Providing contextual relevance. AI can empower physicians to see expansively by quickly interpreting billions of data points – both text and image data – to identify contextually relevant information.</P>
            
<P>Improving clinical reliability. AI helps physicians reliably recognize medical solutions by aggregating and displaying information that may otherwise be easily overlooked. In 2016, IBM Watson AI technology was able to cross-reference 20 million oncology records quickly and correctly diagnose a rare leukemia condition in a patient.</P>
            
<P>Helping physicians communicate objectively. AI can assist by analyzing structured and unstructured patient data and presenting insights for physicians’ consideration.</P>
            
<P>Reducing errors related to human fatigue. Human error is costly and human fatigue can cause errors. Artificial intelligence tools don’t suffer fatigue, distractions, or moods. They can process vast amounts of data at incredible speed and out-perform humans in terms of accuracy.</P>
            
<P>Decreasing mortality rates. AI can help reduce death rates by prioritizing patients in more urgent need. It can also help by recommending individualized treatments.</P>
            
<P>Diminishing medical costs. Frost & Sullivan reports that AI has the potential to improve outcomes by 30 - 40 percent and reduce the cost of treatment by up to 50 percent. Also, new drug development and vaccines are time-consuming and costly. AI can be used to process the estimated 30 million lab and data reports.</P>
